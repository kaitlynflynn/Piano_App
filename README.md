# Piano_App
I've been playing piano since age 4 so I thought it would be fun to try creating a Piano App for my first C# project! This is my first time builing a Windows Forms App utilizing Visual Studio 2017 which is quite exciting. If you follow the steps below, you should be able to run a version of it to your own laptop/PC. Enjoy! 

## Steps to take for Running this App on Laptop/PC
1. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your computer *(this was built using Visual Studio 2017; if you need to install, go to the link for this in the "BUILT WITH" section below and download for free)*
2. Go to the repo you want to clone on GitHub. 
3. Choose the **Clone or download** button and then choose the **Copy to Clipboard** button from the dropdown menu to copy the secure URL for the GitHub repo. 

4. In Visual Studio, choose the **Team Explorer** tab to open **Team Explorer**. If you do not see the tab, open it from **View > Team Explorer.**
5. In Team Explorer, under the **Local Git Repositories** section, choose the **Clone** command and then paste the URL of the GitHub page into the text box. 

6. Choose the **Clone** button to clone the project files to a local Git repository. Depending on the size of the repo, this process may take several minutes. 
7. After the repo has been cloned to your system, in **Team Explorer** choose the **Open** command on the context (right-click) menu of the newly cloned repo.

7. Choose the **Show Folder View** command to view the files in **Solution Explorer**. You can now successfully browse folder and files in the cloned repo, and view and search the code in Visual Studio code editor, complete with syntax colorization and other features.

## Built With
For this application I built this entirely with the following:
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017)
###### Fun Fact: The keys of the keyboard were built within the Design Form of VS2017 by inserting buttons from the toolbox & then sizing and coloring them accordingly :smile:
