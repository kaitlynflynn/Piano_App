# Piano_App
I've been playing piano since age 4 so I thought it would be fun to try creating a Piano App for my first C# project! This is my first time builing a Windows Forms App utilizing Visual Studio 2017 which is quite exciting. If you follow the steps below, you should be able to run a version of it to your own laptop/PC. Enjoy!
