# Piano_App
I've been playing piano since age 4 so I thought it would be fun to try creating a Piano App for my first C# project! This is my first time builing a Windows Forms App utilizing Visual Studio 2017 which is quite exciting. If you follow the steps below, you should be able to run a version of it to your own laptop/PC. Enjoy! 

# Steps to take for Running this App on Laptop/PC
Coming Soon!

## Built With
For this application I built this entirely with the following:
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017)
###### Fun Fact: The keys of the keyboard were built within the Design Form of VS2017 by inserting buttons from the toolbox & then sizing and coloring them accordingly :smile:
